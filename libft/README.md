What is libft?

Libft is the first 42 project(Lib = library, ft = fourty two). The task is to recreate various standard C library functions, as well as extra things which might be useful, like linked lists for example.

How to use: I have made a Makefile that should ease the things. After clone, type "make" to build the library, and make fclean to delete the library and binary files afterwards
